# Plan: Add a repository README

## Goal
Create a top-level `README.md` that explains what this config repo is, how to use it, and how to validate changes.

## Proposed steps
1. **Inspect repo structure and existing docs for source material**
   - Review `justfile`, `flake.nix`, and key directories (`nix/`, `opencode/`, `openclaw/`, etc.) to capture accurate descriptions.
   - Reuse wording from existing in-repo docs where possible for consistency.

2. **Define README outline**
   - Title + short project description.
   - Prerequisites (Nix/flake setup assumptions).
   - Common commands:
     - `just check`
     - `just build`
     - `just switch`
     - `just test`
   - Repository layout section (short descriptions of major directories).
   - Typical workflow for making changes.
   - Optional troubleshooting notes (if useful from current scripts/config).

3. **Draft `README.md`**
   - Keep it concise and action-oriented.
   - Include command snippets and expected intent of each command.
   - Mention that `just test` should be run after changes, and for nix-file changes run `just check && just build`.

4. **Validate accuracy against repo**
   - Ensure commands documented in README exist in `justfile`.
   - Ensure directory descriptions match actual structure.

5. **Finalize formatting**
   - Clean markdown headings and code blocks.
   - Keep first-time onboarding steps near top.

## Verification
- Confirm `README.md` exists at repo root and renders clearly.
- Quick consistency check against `justfile` and tree.

## Execution notes
- This change is documentation-only; no build/test commands are required unless requested.
