# Plan: Add README

## Goal
Create a clear project README that explains what this repo is, how to use it, and how to validate changes.

## Steps
1. Inspect existing repository structure and any current documentation to avoid duplication.
2. Draft README sections based on this repo’s purpose and workflows:
   - Project overview
   - Prerequisites
   - Key commands (`just check`, `just build`, `just switch`, `just test`)
   - Typical workflow for making changes
   - Repo structure (high-level)
3. Create/update `README.md` with concise, practical instructions.
4. Validate that commands and references in the README match the actual repo files/tasks.
5. Run required verification commands after edits:
   - `just test`
   - If nix files are changed: `just check && just build`
6. Summarize what was added and any follow-up improvements.

## Deliverable
- A committed-ready `README.md` that helps new contributors understand and work with this config repo quickly.
