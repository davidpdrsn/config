# 📘 Plan: Improve Project Documentation ✨

## 🎯 Goal
Create clear project documentation that explains what this repo is, how to use it, and how to validate changes ✅

## 🧭 Steps
1. 🔍 Inspect existing repository structure and any current documentation to avoid duplication.
2. 📝 Draft documentation sections based on this repo’s purpose and workflows:
   - 🏠 Project overview
   - 📦 Prerequisites
   - 🛠️ Key commands (`just check`, `just build`, `just switch`, `just test`)
   - 🔄 Typical workflow for making changes
   - 🗂️ Repo structure (high-level)
3. ✍️ Create/update project documentation with concise, practical instructions.
4. ✅ Validate that commands and references in the documentation match the actual repo files/tasks.
5. 🧪 Run required verification commands after edits:
   - `just test`
   - If nix files are changed: `just check && just build`
6. 📣 Summarize what was added and any follow-up improvements.

## 📦 Deliverable
- A commit-ready documentation update that helps new contributors understand and work with this config repo quickly 🚀
